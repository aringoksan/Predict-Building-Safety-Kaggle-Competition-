# Predict-Building-Safety-Kaggle-Competition

Dataset is obtained from kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-the-building-safety-under-the-earthquake). Dataset contains synthetic data for building variables and siesmec variables. These variables are used in FEM simulation to obtain the target variable (max drift). Max drift value is predicted using different machine learning algorithms and best prediction model is used for hyperparameter optimization to obtain final model. Feature engineering is applied to the dataset.
